<h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bread Flour 3 1/2 cups</li>
<li>Water 2 cups</li>
<li>Salt 1/4 teaspoon</li>
<li>Dry Instant Yeast 1 teaspoon</li>
<li>Thickly Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>In a medium mixing bowl, add <b>cool water, dry instant 
    yeast, and salt</b>.</li>
<li><b>Add flour</b> to the bowl. Recommend adding gently on 
    the side of the bowl to reduce clumping.</li>
<li><b>Add cheese</b> to the bowl. Recommend adding gently to the top of the flour.</li>
<li><b>Stir ingredients gently</b> until incorporated. Recommend using the end of a spoon 
    handle. The smaller surface area reduces how much dough sticks to the spoon</li>
<li><b>First Proof:</b> Cover with cling wrap, let sit on the counter for 8-24 hours.</li>
<li>Place <b>dutch oven</b> into the oven and <b>preheat to 450</b>.<b>&#176;</b></li> 
<li><b>Second Proof:</b> While oven preheats, prepare the second proof. Using the spoon, 
    <b>roll the dough</b> in the mixing bowl once more into a ball, knocking out some of 
    the air. Once reshaped, spray the skillet with non-stick cooking spray, and <b>transfer 
    dough</b> to the skillet. <em>It is important to use a skillet that is the same or lower
    diameter than the dutch oven to make the transfer easy.</em> <b>Cover</b> with a lint-free 
    towel. Allow to proof for <b>30 minutes</b>.</li>
<li>Carefully <b>remove dutch oven</b> from the oven, spray with non-stick cooking spray, and <b>pour the dough</b> 
    out of the skillet and into the dutch oven. Gently swirl the dutch oven to reshape and center the 
    dough. <b>Cover and bake for 30 minutes</b>.</li>
<li>Uncover dutch oven and <b>bake for 5-15 minutes</b> more.</li>
