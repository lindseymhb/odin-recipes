<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar. Stir well.</li>
    <li>Add melted butter, and use a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
    <li>Pour ingredients into the springform  pan and press firmly into the 
        bottom and up the sides of the pan. Set aside.
</ol>
<h3>Cheesecake</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325.&#176;</li>
    <li>Stir the cream cheese using a stand or hand mixer in a large bowl until
     smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
    <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Stir until well-combined.</li>
    <li>Gradually add lightly beaten eggs one at a time while the mixer stirs on low speed.
        After all are added, scrape the sides and mix until well combined.</li>
    <li>Pour cheesecake batter into the prepared springform pan. Place pan on 
        cookie sheet lined with foil to protect against leaks.</li>
    <li>Transfer to center rack of the oven and bake for 50-60 minutes until 
        edges are slightly puffed and just beginning to turn a light golden 
        brown. The center should still be jiggly, but spring back to the 
        touch. Don't over-bake.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Then, use a night to 
        gently loosen crust from the pan <em>without removing the ring of the 
        springform pan.</em></li>
    <li>Allow to cool for 1-2 more hours or until near room temperature before
         transferring to refrigerator. Allow to cool overnight (or at least 
         6 hours).</li>
</ol>
<em>Note: I remove the ring of the springform pan just before serving 
    then return it to the pan to store.</em>
